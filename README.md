A database is held on the master server that synchronises web portal user data and Discord user data.

**Technologies Used**

- Node.JS
- MongoDB
- React
- Discord.JS

## Community Forum (2018)
**A fully fledged community forum that marked my first major Node.JS project.**

This project maintained most common features of a modern online forum and it's frontend was designed completely from scratch.
Since this project, my code has improved drastically, along with my understanding of core programming principles.
I like to think this shows in the difference between this project and my more recent projects.

**Technologies Used**

- Node.JS
- MongoDB
- JQuery
